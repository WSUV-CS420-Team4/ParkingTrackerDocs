# First Semester Timeline

- Tuesday, October 21st - SRS complete date, will be sent to Pete for review and uploaded on Angel. Make progress on prototype design.
- Tuesday, October 28th - Continue to work on prototype, good time to start the XML main activity layout as this may require much tweaking.
- Tuesday, November 4th - Present the prototype design in class, by this point we should be pretty set on what the app will look like.
- Thursday, November 6th - Email Vito all necessary Android permissions you may need, and icon for the app should be designed. Only one image need to be made then use a website like http://makeappicon.com/ to get all the different size pictures required. This will allow us to lock down the AndroidManifest.xml and keep a dummy version on github without the API keys
- Tuesday, November 11th - Full speed ahead on implementing the design in the Android project. Deal with any issues that may arise.
- Tuesday, November 18th - Continue implementing the prototype and add functionality where possible.
- Tuesday, November 25th - Off week
- Tuesday, December 2nd - Must have concrete plan for what we are presenting to the class as our semester prototype.
- Tuesday, December 9th - Make sure we meet our prototype goal and wrap up any loose ends.
- Thursday, December 11th - Final presentation
